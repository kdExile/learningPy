ACT IV
SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.
DUKE
What, is Antonio here?
ANTONIO
Ready, so please your grace.
DUKE
I am sorry for you; you are come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
Incapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.
ANTONIO
I have heard
Your grace has taken great pains to moderate
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy’s reach, my patience I
Will set against his fury, and am armed
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The noisy tyranny and rage of his.
DUKE
Go someone, call the Jew into the court.
SALERIO
He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
Enter SHYLOCK
DUKE
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That you’ll perform this mad display of malice
Till the final hour, and then ’tis thought
You’ll show your mercy and reveal a soul
More lofty than this show of cruelty;
And where you now exact the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
You will not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touched with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a portion of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
SHYLOCK
I have informed your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But say it is my fancy. Is it answered?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it poisoned? Are you answered yet?
Some men are sick when beef is cooked too rare;
Some men go mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe whines its song,
Cannot contain their urine: Reason plays
No part in it. So can I give no reason,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A suit against a bankrupt. Are you answered?
BASSANIO
This is no answer, you unfeeling man,
To excuse the madness of your cruelty.
SHYLOCK
I am not bound to please you with my answers.
BASSANIO
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
SHYLOCK
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
BASSANIO
Offenses need not always lead to hate.
SHYLOCK
What, would you let a serpent sting you twice?
ANTONIO
I pray you, do not argue with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the tide go out instead of in.
Make no more offers, and, with dignity,
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
BASSANIO
For your three thousand ducats, here is six.
SHYLOCK
He missed the day, and ducats will not do.
DUKE
What mercy can you hope for, showing none?
SHYLOCK
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and degrading work,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Why sweat they under burdens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours! You will answer
“The slaves are ours:” so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
DUKE
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Comes here today.
SALERIO
My lord, a messenger
With letters from the doctor waits outside.
DUKE
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
BASSANIO
Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Before you lose for me one drop of blood.
ANTONIO
I am the sickling of the herd, the one
The wolves will single out and chase and harry
To the death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me.
You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write my epitaph.
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk
DUKE
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
NERISSA
From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
Presenting a letter
BASSANIO
Why do you whet your knife so vigorously?
SHYLOCK
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
GRATIANO
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
You make your knife more keen; but metal cannot,
Nor the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Of your sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce you?
SHYLOCK
No, none that you have wit enough to make.
GRATIANO
You almost make me waver in my faith,
To trust the doctrine of Pythagoras,
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: your currish spirit
Was once a wolf, hanged for eating men,
Whose soul fled to your mother’s womb
And made the human baby like a wolf,
Relentless, starving, bloody, ravenous.
SHYLOCK
Till you can rail the seal from off my bond,
You only hurt your lungs to speak so loud:
Repair your wit, good youth, or it will fall
To hopeless ruin. I stand here for law.
DUKE
This letter from Bellario commends
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?
NERISSA
He awaits your grace nearby,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
DUKE
With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
CLERK
[Reads]
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your
letter I am very sick: but in the instant that your
messenger came, in visitation was with me a young doctor
of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I told him of the
controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant:
we turned over many books together: he is furnished with
my opinion, bettered by his own learning, and at my
request he comes to fill your grace’s request in my stead. I
beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment; for I
never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave
him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better
publish his commendation.
DUKE
You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
PORTIA
I do, my lord.
DUKE
Then welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the issue here?
PORTIA
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
DUKE
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
PORTIA
Is your name Shylock?
SHYLOCK
Shylock is my name.
PORTIA
The suit is strange, the bond pernicious,
Yet it’s written so Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?
ANTONIO
Ay, so he says.
PORTIA
Do you confess the bond?
ANTONIO
I do.
PORTIA
Then must the Jew be merciful.
SHYLOCK
On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
PORTIA
The quality of mercy is not forced.
It drops as freely as the rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesses him that gives and him that takes:
It’s mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The reigning monarch better than his crown;
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,
Which thus inspires the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptered sway;
It is an attribute of God himself;
And earthly power is most like to God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be your plea, consider this,
If justice had its way, then none of us
Would see salvation: we must pray for mercy;
And that same prayer will teach us all to render
Deeds of mercy. Give what you would have,
And mitigate the justice of your plea;
For if you press your suit, this court of Venice
Must be merciless against the merchant there.
SHYLOCK
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
PORTIA
Is he not able to discharge the money?
BASSANIO
Yes, here I offer it to him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times over,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
But this will not suffice, so it appears
That only wicked malice drives him on,
For he has not been harmed at all.
O learned doctor, can’t you bend the law
A little, using your authority?
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
PORTIA
It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
It would be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Would rush into the state: it cannot be.
SHYLOCK
A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honor you!
PORTIA
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
SHYLOCK
Here it is, most reverend doctor, here it is.
PORTIA
You have the offer of three times your money.
SHYLOCK
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.
PORTIA
Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice your money; bid me tear the bond.
SHYLOCK
When it is paid according to the letter.
You seem, though young, to be a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Has been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
ANTONIO
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.
PORTIA
Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
SHYLOCK
O noble judge! O excellent young man!
PORTIA
For the intent and purpose of the law
Has full relation to the penalty,
Which here appears exact upon the bond.
SHYLOCK
’Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder are you than your looks!
PORTIA
Therefore lay bare your bosom.
SHYLOCK
Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: does it not, noble judge?
“Nearest his heart:” those are the very words.
PORTIA
It is so. Is there a balance here to weigh
The flesh?
SHYLOCK
I have it ready — honest weight.
PORTIA
Have near some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he should bleed to death.
SHYLOCK
Is it so nominated in the bond?
PORTIA
It is not so expressed: but what of that?
’Twere good you do so much for charity.
SHYLOCK
I cannot find it; it’s not in the bond.
PORTIA
You, merchant, have you anything to say?
ANTONIO
But little: I am armed and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: often, as a joke,
She lets a wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from lingering penance
Of such misery she sets me free.
Commend me to your honorable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio’s end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her to judge
Whether Bassanio once was truly loved.
Regret but this: that you shall lose your friend;
For he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I’ll pay it presently with all my heart.
BASSANIO
Antonio, I am married to a wife
Who is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteemed above your life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.
PORTIA
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
GRATIANO
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
NERISSA
’Tis well you offer it behind her back;
Or else the wish would make a troubled house.
SHYLOCK
[Aside] These are Christian husbands! I have a daughter;
Any of the sons of Abraham
Would make a better husband than a Christian!
We trifle time: I pray you pursue sentence.
PORTIA
A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is yours.
The court awards it, and the law bestows it.
SHYLOCK
Most rightful judge!
PORTIA
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
SHYLOCK
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
PORTIA
Just a moment; there is something else.
This contract gives you not a jot of blood;
The words expressly are “a pound of flesh:”
Take then your bond, receive your pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting of it, if you shed
One drop of Christian blood, your lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscated.
GRATIANO
O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
SHYLOCK
Is that the law?
PORTIA
If you exceed the bond,
Since you demanded justice, be assured
That you’ll have justice, more than you desire.
GRATIANO
O learned judge! Shylock, a learned judge!
SHYLOCK
I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go.
BASSANIO
Here is the money.
PORTIA
Stop.
The Jew refused — the time for it is passed.
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
GRATIANO
O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
PORTIA
Therefore prepare yourself to cut the flesh.
Shed no blood, nor cut you less nor more,
But just a pound of flesh: if you cut more
Or less than just a pound, however slight
The difference — a bit of dust, a hair —
You die and all your goods are confiscate.
GRATIANO
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
PORTIA
Why are you waiting, Shylock? take your forfeit.
SHYLOCK
Give me my principal, and let me go.
BASSANIO
I have it ready for you: here it is.
PORTIA
He has refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
GRATIANO
A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
SHYLOCK
Can I not choose to have my principal,
Forgiving every bit of usury?
PORTIA
You shall have nothing but the forfeiture,
Taken at your peril. Go ahead.
SHYLOCK
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I must withdraw my suit. He owes me nothing!
See? I void the bond!
PORTIA
Tarry, Shylock.
The law has yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He sought the life of any citizen,
The party he conspired against shall have
The right to half his goods; the other half
Is taken by the treasury of the state;
And the offender’s life lies at the mercy
Of the duke alone, without appeal.
In which predicament, I say, you stand;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly, too,
You have conspired against the very life
Of the defendant. Therefore, on your knees!
Down, and beg the mercy of the duke.
GRATIANO
Beg that you may have leave to hang yourself:
And yet, your wealth being forfeit to the state,
You haven’t got enough to buy a rope.
They’ll have to hang you at the state’s expense.
DUKE
So you can see the difference of our spirits,
I pardon you your life before you ask.
For half your wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state.
SHYLOCK
Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you remove the prop
That holds it up. You take my life already
When you take the means whereby I live.
PORTIA
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
GRATIANO
A noose for free, and nothing else, except
The rent-free use of a limb to hang it from.
ANTONIO
So please my lord the duke and all the court,
I am content to give my half to him,
If he will sign a document in court,
That gives the whole of it, upon his death,
Unto Lorenzo, now his son-in-law,
And to his daughter Jessica.
DUKE
He shall do this, or else I do recant
The pardon that I gave to spare his life.
ANTONIO
And witness this for me as well, that I
Repent the malice that I showed the Jew.
I offered only hate, and he returned
The loan with usury. But Jesus said
To love my enemy, and I did not.
This doctor’s words of mercy struck me hard,
Reminding me of what a Christian is.
My labor should have been to bring his heart,
By reason and example, unto Christ,
Not goad him till he sought my own.
BASSANIO
It sounds as if you want to blame yourself!
ANTONIO
I’m not absolved because another man is worse.
PORTIA
Are you contented, Jew? what do you say?
SHYLOCK
I am content.
PORTIA
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
SHYLOCK
I pray you, give me leave to go from here.
I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.
DUKE
You may go — but do it.
Exit SHYLOCK
